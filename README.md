The CLI has been coded for you using a library called [Sharprompt][https://github.com/shibayan/Sharprompt], but it is bare-bones and filled with TODOs. You can find and edit the code in LevelUpGame/levelup/cli/Game.cs.  All the system operations are coded in LevelUpGame/levelup/GameController.cs. Other than CreateCharacter, which is implemented as an example of Cucumber testing, all the system operations are empty "do nothing" implementations.
